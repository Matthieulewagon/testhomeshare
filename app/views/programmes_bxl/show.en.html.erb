  <p>It is in July 2009 that R&eacute;gis and Claire de Kerautem create the ASBL 1toit2ages in Belgium,.</p>
  <p>It starts in Brussels before continuing its development three years later in Wallonia, following numerous calls from seniors and students motivated by this win-win project.</p>
  <p>The non-profit organization 1toit2ages is composed of a team with very different profiles; lawyer, social worker, journalist, neuropsychologist, economist, professors, senior ... each bringing his skills, his knowledge, his sensitivity and his listening to this purely human project.</p>

  <p><b>How does this scheme work ?</b></p>
<p>The purpose of ASBL &lsquo;1 Toit 2 Ages&rsquo; is to put likeminded householders and students in touch, to provide student accommodation that is cost-effective, mutually beneficial and based on respect and trust.</p>
<p>To start with, we meet individuals who express an interest in our scheme :</p>
<p>We visit the householder to check the quality of the proposed accommodation. During an in-depth interview, we discuss the type of arrangement which suits them best.</p>
<p>Similarly, we interview possible student participants to assure ourselves that they have the right frame of mind for intergenerational living and to assess their suitability for householders.</p>
<p>When we have identified householders and students who appear compatible we put them in contact.</p>
<p>Once they have met, potential participants are invited to decide if they want to go ahead with the arrangement. If so, a personalised agreement between participants is prepared, specifying the arrangement that they have chosen, and they are asked to subscribe to our association.</p>
<p>Our intention is to support the maintenance and strengthening of connections between generations, to their mutual benefit and enrichment.</p>
<p>1toit2ages is now active in Bruxelles, Namur, Mons, Louvain La Neuve, Liege, Tournai, Gembloux, et Marche en Famenne.</p>
