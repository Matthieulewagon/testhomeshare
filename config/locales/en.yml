# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide

  ProgBX_SchemeTitle: "How does our programme work ?"
  ProgBX_Scheme1: "The purpose of 1Toit2Ages is to put likeminded householders and students in touch, to       provide student accommodation that is cost-effective, mutually beneficial and based on respect and trust."
  ProgBX_Scheme2: "To start with, we meet individuals who express an interest in our scheme. We visit the       householder to check the quality of the proposed accommodation. During an in-depth interview, we discuss the type       of arrangement which suits them best."
  ProgBX_Scheme3: "Similarly, we interview possible student participants to assure ourselves that they have the       right frame of mind for intergenerational living and to assess their suitability for householders. When we have       identified householders and students who appear compatible we put them in contact."
  ProgBX_Scheme4: "Once they have met, potential participants are invited to decide if they want to go ahead       with the arrangement. If so, a personalised agreement between participants is prepared, specifying the arrangement       that they have chosen, and they are asked to subscribe to our association."
  ProgBX_Scheme5: "Our intention is to support the maintenance and strengthening of connections between       generations, to their mutual benefit and enrichment."
  ProgBX_Scheme6: "1Toit2Ages is now active in Brussels, Namur, Mons, Louvain-La-Neuve, Liège, Tournai,       Gembloux, Marche-en-Famenne and Charleroi."
