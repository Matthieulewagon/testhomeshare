  ProgBX_Scheme2: "To start with, we meet individuals who express an interest in our scheme. We visit the       householder to check the quality of the proposed accommodation. During an in-depth interview, we discuss the type       of arrangement which suits them best."
  ProgBX_Scheme3: "Similarly, we interview possible student participants to assure ourselves that they have the       right frame of mind for intergenerational living and to assess their suitability for householders. When we have       identified householders and students who appear compatible we put them in contact."
  ProgBX_Scheme4: "Once they have met, potential participants are invited to decide if they want to go ahead       with the arrangement. If so, a personalised agreement between participants is prepared, specifying the arrangement       that they have chosen, and they are asked to subscribe to our association."
  ProgBX_Scheme5: "Our intention is to support the maintenance and strengthening of connections between       generations, to their mutual benefit and enrichment."
